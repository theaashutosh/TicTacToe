# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It can be played in two modes: single-player mode against a computer opponent or a two-player mode.

## Description

The Tic Tac Toe game, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a two-player game where players choose 'X' or 'O' and take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. In single-player mode, the computer randomly places its marks.

## Installation
